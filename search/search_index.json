Competition Terminology","text":"<p> Following are the definitions of some competition terminologies: </p> <ul> <li>Collision: Any contact between the colliders of the simulated vehicle and the racetrack bounds (except the wheels touching the ground) is considered a collision. A collision will incur a compounding penalty of 10 seconds (i.e. 10 seconds for first collision, 20 seconds for the second, 30 seconds for the third, and so on). Colliding more than 5 times in a single racing event will lead to disqualification. Each collision will automatically reset the vehicle to the nearest checkpoint (your localization algorithm will have to be robust against this re-setting action). Lap timer will not reset upon collision.</li> <li>Warm-Up Lap: This is the first lap of a race. The time or collisions during the warm-up lap will not be considered. This lap acts as a buffer since your algorithms may take time to launch and connect with the simulator, while the lap timer is on.</li> <li>Race Laps: These are a set of 10 laps immediately following the warm-up lap. The race laps start as soon as the vehicle crosses the finish line in the warm-up lap. The time and collisions of the race laps will be considered.</li> <li>Cool-Down Lap: This is the last lap of a race. The time or collisions during the cool-down lap will not be considered. Completing this lap is not required for the competition, but this can be a good time to \"show-off\" your skills without worrying about collisions!</li> <li>Checkpoints: The racetrack has several \"virtual\" checkpoints, spaced approximately equally along the track. These checkpoints cover the entire width of the racetrack and are triggered as the vehicle passes through them. The start/finish line is the final \"special\" checkpoint. The exact location of the checkpoints will not be revealed to the participants.</li> <li>Lap Time: This is the amount of time that the vehicle takes to complete one full lap around the racetrack. The timer starts as soon as the previous lap ends and stops after the current lap ends. Failing to pass all the checkpoints before crossing the finish line (e.g. driving in opposite direction) will not stop the lap timer.</li> <li>Race Time: This is the cumulative time that the vehicle takes to complete 10 race laps around the racetrack. The timer starts as soon as the warm-up lap ends and stops after the 10th race lap ends. Collision penalties are added separately.</li> <li>Best Lap Time: This is the amount of time that the vehicle took to complete the fastest race lap around the racetrack. This is the minimum lap time across all the 10 race laps.</li> <li>Average Lap Time: This is the average time that the vehicle took to complete a race laps (out of 10 race laps) around the racetrack. This is the statistical mean of all the 10 race lap times.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"competitions/f1tenth-sim-racing-rules/#23-competition-execution","title":"2.3.

Submission Privacy","text":"<p> This is a competition, and all teams have the right to keep their source code hidden from their competitors. Here are a few strategies to keep in mind: </p> <ul> <li>Source Code: Teams can host their source code in a private GitHub repository for collaboration and version control. GitHub now allows hosting unlimited private repositories for personal accounts and organizations.</li> <li>Containers: Teams can push their Docker container images to a private DockerHub repository. As of now, DockerHub allows hosting one free private repository for each user account.</li> <li>Data: Teams can store their data in an encrypted and secure cloud storage platform with link-sharing disabled. Alternatively, storing data locally (with a hard-drive backup) is also an option.</li> </ul> <p> However, after the competition, we encourage teams to publish their source code on GitHub under an open-source license. We also encourage teams to make their Docker containers public on DockerHub. Teams can also choose to make other race data (e.g. videos, logs, reports, etc.) publicly available. This will increase the visibility of their work and increase the quality of the future competitions. </p>"}]}
