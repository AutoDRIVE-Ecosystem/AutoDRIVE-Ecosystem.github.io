Please see the accompanying video for a glimpse of the F1TENTH digital twins in action. </p> <p> <p></p> <p> The main focus of the Sim Racing League is a virtual competition with simulated cars and environments, which is accessible to everyone across the globe. For the IROS 2024 competition, each team will be provided with a standardized simulation setup (in the form of a digital twin of the F1TENTH vehicle, and a digital twin of the Porto racetrack) within the high-fidelity AutoDRIVE Simulator. Additionally, teams will also be provided with a working implementation of the AutoDRIVE Devkit to get started with developing their autonomy algorithms. Teams will have to develop perception, planning, and control algorithms to parse the real-time sensor data streamed from the simulator and generate control commands to be fed back to the simulated vehicle. </p> <p>The competition will take place in 2 stages:</p> <ul> <li>Qualification Session: Teams will demonstrate their ability to complete multiple laps around the practice track without colliding with the track bounds at run time.</li> <li>Time-Attack Race: Teams will compete against the clock, on a previously unseen racetrack, to secure a position on the leaderboard.</li> </ul> <p> Since the vehicle, the sensors, the simulator, and the devkit are standardized, teams must develop robust racing algorithms that can deal with the uncertainties of an unseen racetrack. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If you are interested in autonomously racing physical F1TENTH vehicles, please check out the website for 21<sup>st</sup> F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix, which will be held in person at IROS 2024.
