## F1TENTH @ IROS 2024

=== "About"

    <p align="justify">
        F1TENTH Autonomous Racing is a semi-regular competition organized by an international community of researchers, engineers, and autonomous systems enthusiasts. The teams participating in **21st F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix** at IROS 2024 will write software for a 1:10 scaled autonomous race car to fulfill the objectives for the competition: ***drive fast but don’t crash!***

    ### Physical Racing League

    <p align="justify">
        The main focus of the **Physical Racing League** is an in-person competition with physical cars. Each team will bring their own F1TENTH car and write the software for their car. For the competition, teams first take part in a qualification session, where they compete in a time trial to demonstrate the ability to complete multiple laps without colliding with the track bounds at run time. The qualification session determines seeding for the knockout phase, where teams compete head-to-head on the same race track. Since vehicles and hardware are standardized, teams must develop robust perception, planning, and control algorithms that can deal with the uncertainties of a new track and new competitors.

    ### Sim Racing League

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    <p align="justify">
        The main focus of the **Sim Racing League** is a virtual competition with simulated cars. Each team will be provided with the F1TENTH digital twin simulator and have to write the software for their car. For the competition, teams first take part in a qualification session, where they demonstrate the ability to complete multiple laps without colliding with the track bounds at run time. This is followed by a time trial race, where teams compete against the clock to secure a position on the leaderboard. Since vehicles and simulator are standardized, teams must develop robust perception, planning, and control algorithms that can deal with the uncertainties of a new track.

    -	**Registration:** Teams register for the sim racing league.
    -	**Orientation 1:** Organizers will explain the competition rules and guidelines, and demonstrate how to use the simulation framework.
    -	**Orientation 2:** Organizers will check progress of the participating teams and help with any technical difficulties.
    -	**Qualification Round:** Teams will demonstrate successful completion of 10 laps around the practice track provided ahead of time.
    -	**Competition Track Released:** We will release the actual "competition track", which will be used for the final race. This track may be then replicated in the physical race as well.
    -	**Final Race:** We will collect Docker containers from teams, with their algorithms and connect them to the AutoDRIVE Simulator container. Performance metrics of each team will be recorded.
    -	**Results Declared:** Standings of all the teams will be released.
