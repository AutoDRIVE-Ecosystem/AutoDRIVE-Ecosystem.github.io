## About

<p align="justify">
<b>F1TENTH Autonomous Racing</b> is a semi-regular competition organized by an international community of researchers, engineers, and autonomous systems enthusiasts. The teams participating in the <b>21st F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix</b> at IROS 2024 will write software for a 1:10 scaled autonomous race car to fulfill the objectives for the competition: <b><i>drive fast but don’t crash!</i></b>
</p>

<!-- <div class="grid" markdown> -->
<p align="justify">
This time, we are organizing the first ever <b>F1TENTH Sim Racing League</b>, which leverages <a href="https://autodrive-ecosystem.github.io">AutoDRIVE Ecosystem</a> to model and simulate the digital twin of an F1TENTH racecar within a virtual racetrack. Please see the accompanying video for more details. The main focus of the Sim Racing League is a virtual competition with simulated cars and environments.

<p align="justify">
Competition registration is free of cost and is seperate from the conference registration itself. The above form is only for competition registration, and for orientation and information sessions. Although you can participate in the F1TENTH Sim Racing League without attending the conference, we strongly encourage all competition participants to attent the conference in person. This will help you connect with the broader AutoDRIVE and F1TENTH communities, and you can also witness/participate in the physical F1TENTH autonomous racing competition!

## Results

To be announced on Oct 07, 2024.
